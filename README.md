# T-bert

There is question that comes up when re-creating a beloved classic videogame, and that is how can you truly iterate on such an already quality experience. It is difficult to add on your own twists and changes, as you could risk destroying and not matching the already refined experience and feel of the original, thus creating a worse game. Though it is not all about creating a better version, but instead creating a version of this older game that allows newer and older generations to experience it in new ways.

My group and I took on this challenge with the game Q*bert.

This group consisted of the following members...
Kristijan Zvonarek (Producer and Audio Designer)

Yichen Dai (Programmer)

Vivian Zhao (Programmer)

Alex Chow (Artist)

Danny Yu (Artist)


Phase One - The Starting Stages of Development

It is a priority to get to know eachother before you create games together, as it is almost impossible to collaborate at this level and scale without doing so first. Immediately I found it challenging as a producer to work this out, being my first time doing something like this, but my group really took initiative to getting to know eachother. We quickly formed a plan, formed boundaries, and formed a group atmosphere where we were able to productively and enjoyably work on our game.

At NHSGA, there was about 8 hours of available time to work at the ETC, and the rest of the day was free for us to go and spend time on or around campus as we pleased. This is where my role as producer really took form, as I had to plan out a reasonable amount of work that needed to be completed within certain timeframes and fairly divide this work between each group member. We couldn't just have fun at all times as we had a strict deadline for submission of our re-creation.

Getting to work right away, we created a Design Document to scope out what we wanted to accomplish and create in our re-creation of Q*bert, aptly named according to our desired theming of it, T-bert.
