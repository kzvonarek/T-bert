# T-bert

There is question that comes up when re-creating a beloved classic videogame, and that is how can you truly iterate on such an already quality experience. It is difficult to add on your own twists and changes, as you could risk destroying and not matching the already refined experience and feel of the original, thus creating a worse game. Though it is not all about creating a better version, but instead creating a version of this older game that allows newer and older generations to experience it in new ways.

My group and I took on this challenge with the game Q*bert.

This group consisted of the following members...

Kristijan Zvonarek (Producer and Audio Designer)
Yichen Dai (Programmer)
Vivian Zhao (Programmer)
Alex Chow (Artist)
Danny Yu (Artist)

All of us brought to the table our prior knowledge, and the new knowledge we were taught during the three week learning period of the NHSGA at Carnegie Mellon to take one week to plan out, create, and present a recreation of Q*bert, which we call T-bert.
