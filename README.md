# T-bert - A Remake of Q*bert

There is question that comes up when re-creating a beloved classic videogame, and that is how can you truly iterate on such an already quality experience. It is difficult to add on your own twists and changes, as you could risk destroying and not matching the already refined experience and feel of the original, thus creating a worse game. While it is not all about creating a better version, creating one that allows newer and older generations to experience it in new ways is important.

My group and I took on this challenge with the game Q*bert.

This group consisted of the following members...

Kristijan Zvonarek (Producer and Sound Designer)

Yichen Dai (Programmer)

Vivian Zhao (Programmer)

Alex Chow (Artist)

Danny Yu (Artist)

# Overview

It is a priority to get to know eachother before you create games together, as it is almost impossible to collaborate at this level and scale without doing so first. Immediately I found it challenging as a producer to work this out, being my first time doing something like this, but my group really took initiative to getting to know eachother. We quickly formed a plan, formed boundaries, and formed a group atmosphere where we were able to productively and enjoyably work on our game.

At NHSGA (National High School Game Avademy), there was about 8 hours of available time to work at the facility, and the rest of the day was free for us to go and spend time on or around campus as we pleased. This is where my role as producer really took form, as I had to plan out a reasonable amount of work that needed to be completed within certain timeframes and fairly divide this work between each group member. We couldn't just have fun at all times as we had a strict deadline for submission of our re-creation.

Getting to work right away, we created a Design Document to scope out what we wanted to accomplish and create in our re-creation of Q*bert, aptly named according to our desired theming of it, T-bert.

**Design Document -**
[Q_bert Game Design Document.pdf](https://github.com/kzvonarek/T-bert/files/9612079/Q_bert.Game.Design.Document.pdf)

To be brief on our design principles, for our re-creation we wanted to focus on the pillars of the original game and keeping them as closely refined as they were in the original, but bringing them up to par with a more refined control scheme using the arrow keys. It is important to maintain the original goal, that being chnging the colors of all the tiles and avoiding the enemies to reach a high score. Our twist, was more focused on the art and audio side of the project. We chose to add a theme, that being Pre-Historic. So, Q_bert turned into a dinosaur, Coily became a caveman, Slick became a dodobird, and Sam became a frog, all retaining their original purposes and actions. Our audio also reflected this, having bongos, claves, gongs, and zibraslaps being incorporated into the soundtrack and sound effects.

While I cannot go into detail too much on the art and programming side of this project, while I was only involved in the planning process of them, I can back up the fact that my group members did some incredible work with it. Heres a gameplay video of the final product if you are interested.

# Audio and the Magic of Reaper

I will admit, at first I was not very excited to take on the role of Sound Designer. I came into the program with the desire of programming, and I wanted to be able to do that for whatever game I was assigned. While I didn't get my desired role, maybe it was for the better as I not only explored, to me, a relatively unknown avenue of game creation, but I furthered my personal skills and developed a new ability, to create sound.

I have had experience with music during my middle school journey in percussion, so I honed in on that past experience and focused on percussion in my music and sound. To gain inspiration, I would listen to tribal music, trying to figure out how they were able to combine so many natural and artificial sounds into one cohesive work. This type of music would work well for a pre-historic setting, so I took note on what I could use.

**Instruments and Sounds Used**

Bongos

Claves

Zibraslap

Gong

Snare Drum

Bass Drum

Cymbal

Bfxr 8-bit Audio

**Development**

As you can see, I also noted 8-bit audio, which was a goal of mine to maintain a small bit of Q_bert's retro style in the music and sound effects. To combine and create these sounds, I used Reaper and Bfxr, two relatively easy to learn platforms for creating and mixing audio, which I was able to learn about extensively during the three week learning period of the NHSGA. There was also a provided sound library, that I used minimally for some more obscure pieces of sounds such as the falling of rocks or a gust of wind which I wanted to implement within the audio.

Initially I found it difficult to create audio, as I was very critical on myself with every little aspect of it. Does this sound good, does this flow well, does this sound fit in, is this mixed well, how does this sound compared to other groups? That last question, a toxic one to say the least, was something I asked myself constantly. Within my group's work room, which we shared, there was a very talented audio designer who who had a large amount of experience in this field. He finished his audio within a day. To say the least, this made me feel a bit, at first, worse off when it came to my own audio.

Quickly though, this feeling wore off, as I was able to, with the support of my group mates, personally create some sound that I could be proud of. 

I created melodies, beats, loops, and incoporated reverb, pitch adjustments, and other necessary sound additions. It all came together to form a playful, energetic, and vibrant soundtrack for a just as vibrant and funky feeling game that is T-bert.
